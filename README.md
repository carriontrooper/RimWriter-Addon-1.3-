# RimWriter-Addon-1.3-

Tired of reading RimWriter journals? Skillbooks giving you the yawns?

Fret no longer! Enrich the variety of books available for your bibliophile colonist to read or write!

This mod adds more book types for Jecrell's RimWriter, or more precisely, Mlie's updated version of it.

Amaze your colonists with the comic book! Enchant them with fantasy novels! Intrigue them with mystery novels - and lastly, [REDACTED BY THE ORDER OF THE SUPPRESSION BUREAU]!

Adds comics, fantasy novels, mystery novels, and eldritch tomes to RimWorld... for now.
